## Lecturing

### Almo Collegio Borromeo

<ins>*Advanced Computational Statistics*</ins> (Italian)  
I taught a course at *Almo Collegio Borromeo*, open to external participants, focusing on the computational aspects of statistical methods. The course combined theoretical foundations with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets.

The course was developed under the scientific guidance of **Prof. Emanuele Dolera**; however, I was fully responsible for the design of the syllabus, preparation of lectures and examples, and course delivery.

**Topics covered included:**
- Introduction to data analysis using *R*
- Descriptive statistics: measures of location and dispersion, concentration measures, association and concordance indices
- Statistical inference: regression models and hypothesis testing

## Academic Tutoring

My tutoring activities involved the preparation of additional exercise sets and their presentation during dedicated problem-solving sessions for undergraduate students.
