## Publications

**Enhancing Parameter Control Policies with State Information**  
*Proceedings of the Foundations of Genetic Algorithms (FOGA 2025)*, Leiden, Netherlands, 2025.  
arXiv:2507.08368.  

This work studies dynamic parameter control strategies for randomized optimization algorithms, showing how state information can be exploited to improve theoretical and empirical performance guarantees, **in collaboration with Denis Antipov and Prof. Carola Doerr**.
