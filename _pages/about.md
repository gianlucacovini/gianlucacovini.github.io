I am a first-year PhD student in **Statistics & Computer Science** at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/phd/phd-statistics-and-computer-science).

I obtained my **BSc and MSc in Mathematics** from the [University of Pavia](https://matematica.unipv.it/en/homepage/).

**Research interests:** I am broadly interested in optimal transport and its connections with statistics, optimization, and machine learning, including variational methods and gradient-flow perspectives.
