I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Mathematics at the <a href="https://matematica.unipv.it/en/homepage/">University of Pavia</a>.

I will start the PhD program in Statistics & Computer Science at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/phd/phd-statistics-and-computer-science">Bocconi University</a> in September.
